The toplevel directory contains solutions to the problems in Python, usually
close to the way I originally wrote them, but cleaned up a little afterwards.

The dayXX/ subdirectories contain additional solutions and tools related to
the problem for the corresponding day.

The sampledata/ directory contains the samples given in the problem statement,
useful for testing/debugging.

The testdata/ directory contains the official test inputs and correct outputs.
Use ./run-tests.sh to run all solutions against all testdata automatically.
