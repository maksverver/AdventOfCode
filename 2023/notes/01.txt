Advent of Code 2023 Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Fun: 4/5
Difficulty: 2/5 (edge cases)

For part 2, we need to detect the first and last digit in each line, where
a number can be either a single digit character ('2', '3', etc.) or a word
("two", "three", etc.).

The tricky part is handling cases where numbers overlap (e.g."twone" starts
with 2 and ends with 1) which makes invalidates obvious solutions that do a
simple search-and-replace. The better approach is to blindly do what the
problem asks:

 1. Does the string start with a digit (either a numeric one, or a word)?
    Then return it.
 2. Otherwise, remove the first character, and goto 1.

And similarly for the last digit.
