Fun: 4/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (implementation, algorithms)

We need to expand empty rows and columns. For part 1, a brute force solution
that inserts empty rows and columns works. For part 2 this is obviously not
sufficient, but we can calculate the target height and width of each row and
column, and use that to calculate the new coordinates for all the galaxies.
The accumulate() function is useful here.

This is still an O(N^2) solution. I did have fun figuring out an O(N) solution
instead: see day11/fast.py

Alternative solution: if you can calculate the solution for part 1 with and
without empty rows/columns doubled, then you can derive the solution for
part 2 as something like f(n) = (f(2) - f(1)) Ã— f(n - 1) where f(n) is the sum
of distances when expanding empty rows/columns to height/width `n`.
