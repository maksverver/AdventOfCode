Advent of Code 2023 Day 20: Pulse Propagation
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20

Fun: 3/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (simulation, input decoding)

For part 1, we have to simulate a sort of discrete-time logical circuit.
I liked implementing the digital circuitry, but disliked how much careful
reading was required to figure out what all the modules do. Fortunately,
it was not just a simulation problem.

For part 2, we had to figure out how long it takes before the `rx` module
receives a low pulse. This takes much too long to simulate automatically, so
we have to introspect the input data to determine what it actually does. It
turns out that `rx` receives input from 4 periodic components, so we can
determine their periods individually, and then calculate their LCM.

Introspecting the input in this case was more fun than usual. My main
complaint is that this type of problem, where you have to figure out what a
machine actually does, has been done so much before in Advent of Code problems
and even on Day 8 of this year.

Overall I did have fun part building up the circuit components, and I liked
figuring out how the input is constructed (see: day20/uitleg-1.png etc.)
