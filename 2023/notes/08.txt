Advent of Code 2023 Day 8: Haunted Wasteland
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8

Fun: 2/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (math, insight)

Inspecting the input, we can find out that each “ghost” ends up in a simple
cycle (see comments on FindCycle() below). We can determine the length of each
cycle and then take the least-common-multiple.

I didn't struggle too much with this because this kind of problem is typical
for Advent of Code, but I'm not really a fan of these kind of problems that
require exploiting some mysterious property of the input file.
