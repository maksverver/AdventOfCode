Advent of Code 2023 Day 7: Camel Cards
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7

Fun: 4/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (implementation)

Basically a Poker hand ranking problem, with some custom rules. Part 2
requires replacing jokers with optimal cards, which can be done by brute
force (as I did here), though a smarter solution uses the insight that the
more copies we have of a card, the better the hand is (i.e., there are no
combinations like e.g. a straight flush that would beat e.g. a full house), so
using jokers as the most common card is always optimal. See 07-alt.py for an
explanation of this approach.
