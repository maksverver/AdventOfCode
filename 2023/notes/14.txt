Advent of Code 2023 Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/14

Fun: 2/5
Difficulty: 3/5

Simulation followed by cycle detection. This is something that Advent of Code
has done a number of times already (including on Day 8 of this year!) so the
problem is a little stale at this point.

The interesting part is to figure out how to move the boulders in a line in O(N)
time so that each simulation step takes only O(HW) time, but since the cycle
is detected very early (after 14 steps, in my case) it isn't even necessary to
optimize this.
