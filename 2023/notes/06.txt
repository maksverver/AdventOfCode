Advent of Code 2023 Day 6: Wait For It
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6

Fun: 3/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (math / algorithms)

Interesting little problem. It basically boils down to finding the solutions
to a quadratic equation. See the comments for CountWinning() on how this
solution works, or see 06-exact.py for an exact closed-form solution. The main
tricky part there is to get rounding correct.
