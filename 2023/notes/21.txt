Advent of Code 2023 Day 21: Step Counter
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21

Fun: 1/5
Difficulty: 4/5

Part 1 is kind of fun: determine the number of spaces reachable after exactly
64 steps, which is the number of of squares that have an *even* distance less
than or equal to 64 from the startingpoint.

Part 2 is really annoying because implementing a general solution is nigh
impossible, and instead you are supposed to notice several problems of the
input:

 1. The grid is a square of odd size.
 2. The cells on the edge of the square are clear.
 3. The starting point ('S') is in the exact center.
 4. The center row and column are clear.
 5. The diagonals are clear.
 6. The input is so sparse that the distance between points is the Manhattan
    distance, despite the existence of rocks.
 6. The total number of steps taken in part 2 (26501365) is exactly
    202300 Ã— 131 + 65, where 131 is the size of the square, and 65 is half
    that size.

That means in effect you can calculate how often each space in the eight
triangular parts of the input square can be reached.

What I hated about this problem:

 - While the generic problem is interesting, it's extremely difficult, which
   pretty much requires cheesing it.

 - The sample data doesn't contain the properties that make solving the
   general problem easy, which means solving the sample problem is actually
   *harder* than solving the official input. That's just stupid.
