A standard dynamic programming problem.

Given a template string that contains characters '#', '.' and '?', we are asked
to count the number of ways we can replace the question marks with '.' or '#'
so that the lengths of the runs of consecutive '#' characters matches a given
list of positive integers. For example: "#.?#?.###" matches [1, 2, 3] two ways
"#.##..###" and "#..##.###".

It helps to append a '.' to the end of the pattern, which doesn't change the
number of solutions, but guarantees that each run of '#'s ends with a '.',
removing an edge case at the end of the string.

Now we can solve the problem recursively, using a state that consists of a
pair of integers: the position in the template string and the list of
integers. At each position we either put a '.' or we fill in the next run of
hashes, for a solution that runs in O(|s| Ã— sum(runs)) time.
