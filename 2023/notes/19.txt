Advent of Code 2023 Day 19: Aplenty
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19

Fun: 4/5
Difficulty: 4/5 (implementation)

For part 1, we need to evaluate a list of objects with 4 integer properties
against a list of rules to determine which will eventually be accepted. This
can be done by simulation. See: IsAccepted() in 19.py.

For part 2, we have to determine how many different objects exist that could
be accepted. The range of values is too large to simulate all possibilities.
Instead, we can start with undetermined properties as ranges of possible
values, and narrow them down recursively. See: CountSolutions().

The most fun part of this problem is thinking about how to represent the rules
so that processing them later becomes easy. I ended up rewriting the rules
into a canonical form with only a single conjunction per rule (see:
ParseRules()) which realy simplifies the rest of the solution.

Complaints about this problem:

 1. Parsing is annoying.
 2. The solution for part 2 would be too slow in general, so this solution
    relies on the assumption that the official test data is relatively easy.

Overall still a pretty entertaining problem.
