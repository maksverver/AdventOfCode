Advent of Code 2023 Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

Fun: 2/5
Difficulty: 3/5 (implementation)

The input specifies a list of range-based mappings from integers to shifted
integers. For part 1 we only need to translate individual numbers which is
straightforward to do one-by-one. For part 2 we need to translate ranges of
numbers. The solution is to keep the numbers as consecutive ranges, and split
them up as needed.

The input is constructed in a way so that output ranges don't overlap. This
is not strictly guaranteed by the problem statement, which makes the time
complexity in the worst case much worse than it is in practice.
