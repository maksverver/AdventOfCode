Advent of Code 2023 Day 10: Pipe Maze

Fun: 5/5
Difficulty: 4/5 (implementation, algorithms)

For part 1, we just have to find the loop. This is basically just following the
only possible path.

For part 2, we have to count the area inside the loop. There are several ways:

   1. For each cell, cast a ray and count crossings, using the even-odd rule.
      This can be done in different ways: horizontally, vertically or
      diagonally. (See 10.py for a horizontal version.)
   2. Expand the grid into 2x2 or 3x3 tiles (see 10-alt.py) and then run
      a floodfill.
   3. Calculate the polygon area with some variant of the shoelace theorem.

The variety of ways to tackle this problem made it a lot of fun!
