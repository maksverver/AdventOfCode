This directory contains some of my notes on the problems, as well as my ratings
on how difficult and how much fun the problems are. Obviously these ratings are
highly subjective, but here are my guidelines for the possible ratings:

DIFFICULTY RATINGS:

1: Trivial problem. Just brute force it or do exactly what is asked.
2: A bit of thinking required, maybe slightly-tricky implementation, or some
   nonobvious edge cases that require careful handling, but otherwise nothing
   much special going on.
3: Requires some fundamental insight to be solved, or the implementation is
   particularly trick. Think: obvious dynamic programming, some geometry,
   complicated parsing or tedious simulation. Can still be solved by people
   without a computer science/mathematics degree.
4: Requires a lot of time and effort to get right, and possible specialistic
   knowledge that most people wouldn't know off the top of their heads.
5: Very difficult problems that require a lot of theory.

Subcategorizations which indicate the reason the problem is difficult:

  - parsing
  - insight
  - edge cases
  - implementation
  - computer science
  - math

FUN RATINGS:

1: Just do what you're asked. This includes tedious problems with overly long
   problem statements, and obvious standard problems.
2: Not very exciting, but there is some originality here, or implementing the
   solution is somewhat fun.
3: Middle ground: there is enough substance to the problem to make it
   entertaining, without being particularly memorable. This includes unoriginal
   problems that are still somewhat amusing to solve.
4: Interesting to think about and solve. These problems are usually easy to
   explain, but novel enough that the solution isn't immediately obvious, and
   they may have multiple viable approaches.
5: The most original problems, that are fun to think about, and leave a lasting
   impression.
