Advent of Code 2023 Day 13: Point of Incidence

Fun: 2/5
Difficulty: 2/5 (implementation)

An implementation problem where brute force suffices: simply check every
possible horizontal and vertical line of reflection.

The time complexity is something like O(H×H×W + H×W×W) per pattern in the
worst case, but the patterns in the input are small enough that this works.

For part 1, we only need to check if a grid matches its reflection along a
given horizontal or vertical line.

For part 2, we need to determine which bit we can toggle to make the pattern
reflect along a different line. This can be implemented in a similar way:
instead of checking whether or not the the reflection matches, count the
number of positions where it doesn't match. Then part 1 can be solved by
looking for 0 errors, and part 2 by looking for exactly 1 error.
