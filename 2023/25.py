# From the problem statement, we know that the graph can be partitioned into two
# parts, A and B, that are connected by only 3 edges.
#
# This funciton finds a cut of size 3 between part A and B by first picking a
# random start and finish vertex and then calculating the minimum cut between
# those two vertices. If the size of the minimum cut is greater than 3, then
# start and finish must lie in the same part (A or B) and we retry with a
# different vertex. This takes an expected |A|/|B| + |B|/|A| attempts, or
# max(|A|, |B|) attempts in the worst-case.
#
# Since the runtime of MinCut() is O(E) this gives a time complexity of O(VE)
# worst-case, and O((A/B + B/A)Ã—E) expected, which means the solution is most
# efficient when A and B are approximately the same size, so that A/B + B/A is
# close to 2, and performs worse when e.g. A=1 and B is very large.
